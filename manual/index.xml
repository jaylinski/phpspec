Well, that&amp;rsquo;s a large task. But you can work on simple things first and a design will emerge that will reach all the necessary features.
What is the simplest thing you could add? It should convert a string line into a paragraph with HTML markup, i.e. &amp;ldquo;Hi, there&amp;rdquo; would become &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi, there&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;quot;.
So you can start by doing this. Well, not the boring bits.</description></item><item><title>Installation</title><link>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/installation/</guid><description>phpspec is a PHP library that you&amp;rsquo;ll have in your project development environment. Before you begin, ensure that you have the correct PHP version installed.
phpspec PHP 3.x ^5.6 4.x ^7.0, &amp;lt;7.3 5.x ^7.1, &amp;lt;7.4 6.x ^7.2, &amp;lt;7.5 Installation process: You can install phpspec with all its dependencies through Composer.

BDD is a technique derived from test-first development.
BDD is a technique used at story level and spec level. phpspec is a tool for use at the spec level or SpecBDD. The technique is to first use a tool like phpspec to describe the behaviour of an object you are about to write.</description></item><item><title>Let and Let Go</title><link>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/let-and-letgo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/let-and-letgo/</guid><description>If you need to pass the object into the constructor instead of a method then you can do it like this:
&amp;lt;?php namespace spec; use PhpSpec\ObjectBehavior; use Markdown\Writer; class MarkdownSpec extends ObjectBehavior { function it_outputs_converted_text(Writer $writer) { $this-&amp;gt;beConstructedWith($writer); $writer-&amp;gt;writeText(&amp;#34;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi, there&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;#34;)-&amp;gt;shouldBeCalled(); $this-&amp;gt;outputHtml(&amp;#34;Hi, there&amp;#34;); } } If you have many examples then writing this in each example will get tiresome. You can instead move this to a let method. The let method gets run before each example so each time the parser gets constructed with a fresh mock object.</description></item><item><title>Prophet Objects</title><link>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/prophet-objects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/prophet-objects/</guid><description>Stubs You also need your Markdown parser to be able to format text fetched from an external source such as a file. You decide to create an interface so that you can have different implementations for different types of source.
&amp;lt;?php namespace Markdown; interface Reader { public function getMarkdown(); } You want to describe a method which has an instance of a Reader as an argument. It will call Markdown\Reader::getMarkdown() to get the markdown to format.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading to phpspec 3</title><link>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/upgrading-to-phpspec-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/upgrading-to-phpspec-3/</guid><description>Here is a guide to upgrading a test suite or an extension, based on BC-breaking changes made in phpspec 3.
Upgrading for Users If you are using 3rd party phpspec extensions, you may have to increase the version numbers for those as well.
As PHP 5.5 and below are no longer supported language versions, you will need to upgrade to PHP 5.6 or 7.0+ to use phpspec 3.
Where you have used @param annotations for spec examples, to indicate the required type for a collaborator, you will need to remove these and use explicit typehinting in the method signature instead.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading to phpspec 4</title><link>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/upgrading-to-phpspec-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/upgrading-to-phpspec-4/</guid><description>Here is a guide to upgrading a test suite or an extension, based on BC-breaking changes made in phpspec 4.
Upgrading for Users If you are using 3rd party phpspec extensions, you may have to increase the version numbers for those as well.
As PHP 5 is no longer supported language versions, you will need to upgrade to PHP 7 to use phpspec 4.
Most methods in PhpSpec now have static type hints and return types, this will affect you when you are overriding behaviour from a parent class or implementing an interface.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading to phpspec 5</title><link>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/upgrading-to-phpspec-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaylinski.github.io/phpspec/manual/upgrading-to-phpspec-5/</guid><description>Here is a guide to upgrading a test suite or an extension, based on BC-breaking changes made in phpspec 5:
